# Java Inheritance Demo

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java, specifically focusing on inheritance and constructors. The project includes examples of class hierarchies and constructor overloading.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following main classes:
- `Warrior.java`: A class demonstrating inheritance and constructor overloading
- `ConstructorDemo.java`: Contains the main method with examples of creating Warrior objects

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```
4. Run the demo program:
   ```bash
   java -cp src ConstructorDemo
   ```

## Example Usage

The `ConstructorDemo` class demonstrates two ways to create a Warrior object:
1. Using the default constructor
2. Using a custom constructor with parameters (name, health, strength)

## Learning Objectives

This project helps students understand:
- Constructor overloading
- Inheritance in Java
- Method overriding
- Object creation and initialization
